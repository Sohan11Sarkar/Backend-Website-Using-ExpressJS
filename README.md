# Backend-Website-Using-ExpressJS
I have made this basic backend of the website using the javascript framework ExpressJS which is hosted within Node. So in this website the input field asks us about our age and later the user input is being converted into dog years in the backend. The calculation and everything is done in the backend and later from the backend the result is being throwed back to the web page. So like this its a basic web page which will calculate your age into dog years :)
